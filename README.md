# Good-Burger 

## Desciption 
This is a Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat... and then devour them! The app is partially working and I have planse to fix it in the coming months!!! 

This application will demonstrate a full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.


## Installation 
To run the application locally, first clone this repository.

Next, install the application dependencies. That can be found in the package.json


Run npm install
Finally, run the node server locally.

node server
Now, open the local application on port 4000 at the URL: http://localhost:4000/. If those ports do not work try others!
